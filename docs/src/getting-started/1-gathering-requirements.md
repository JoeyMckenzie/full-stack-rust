# Gathering requirements

Like any web application developer, we've more than likely been part of a product team at one point in time looking to deliver value in some form or another. For us and our spectacular blog, it's worth while to layout a set of criteria that should act as our minimum viable product, often referred to as an MVP, to deliver to users when our work is all said and done.

With our blog, we should expect at the _very_ minimum our users should be able to:

- Navigate to our blog website in a browser of their choice
- Expect a list of blogs upon landing on the home page
- Navigate to individual blogs selecting a blog from the presented list
- Sign up for an account
- Login to an existing account
- Create blogs from a form once authenticated
- Edit an existing blog, given they're the original author

While not _exactly_ a trivial list of blogging website functionality, we cover a lot of bases by providing a basic set of workflows a user can expect from our web app. Not _quite_ exactly reaching feature parity with Facebook, but this will do for our purposes of exploring what Rust is capable of for building fullstack web applications. 

I've found during my time as a seasoned software developer ~~riddled with imposter syndrome~~, it's often beneficial to think like our non-technical peers when developing features in the sense product first engineering.
